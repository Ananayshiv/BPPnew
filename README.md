# 🧊 BPP - Bin Packing Project

The **Bin Packing Problem (BPP)** is a classic NP-hard optimization problem where items of varying sizes must be packed into the fewest number of fixed-capacity bins. This has many real-world applications in:

- 📦 Logistics & shipping
- 💾 Memory & disk allocation
- ☁️ Cloud storage optimization

This project contains Python implementations of several popular bin packing heuristics.
