# BPP - Bin Packing Project

The **Bin Packing Problem (BPP)** is a classic optimization problem where items of different sizes must be packed into a minimal number of bins or containers. It has practical applications in logistics, memory allocation, and file backups. Since it's NP-hard, several heuristic algorithms are used to find approximate solutions efficiently.

This project includes implementations of:
- First Fit
- Best Fit
- Extreme Point heuristic
- Greedy Subset Sum
